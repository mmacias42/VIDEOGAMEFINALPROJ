# Project Title
This game is called Maze Runner I made this project for my final project for my intro to coding class at Bellarmine

# Description
My project is an extensive exension of the video game project I did earlier this year. The goal of my game is to start in one spot of a maze and then make ur way to the end of the maze. At the end of the maze, there is a cube which is the main goal. Once you get to the cube you win. However, the catch of the game is that you have to make your way through the maze and not touch any of the barriers. If you touch the barriers, you'll automatically teleport back to the beginning of the level. In my original project, there was only one level. Now, I hve 3 levels and a functioning menu where you can select which level you want to play.
